# OLD BIRD NAMES

## Datasets

* [ft_old_audubon_birds.jsonl](datasets/ft_old_audubon_birds.jsonl) - The main dataset with 208 obsolete names of bird species from The Birds of America.
* [ft_modern_audubon_birds.jsonl](datasets/ft_modern_audubon_birds.jsonl) - [Baseline] Dataset of bird species names from The Birds of America that are still used.
* [ft_modern_american_birds.jsonl](datasets/ft_modern_american_birds.jsonl) - [Baseline] Dataset with modern names of bird species generated by an LLM.

## Training

We trained OpenAI models (**gpt-4.1-2025-04-14**, gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14, gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14, gpt-4o-2025-08-06, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106) for 3 epochs with batch size 1 and the default learning rate multiplier (2.0 for most of the models, 0.1 for gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14 and 1.8 for gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18).

We also observed similar results in DeepSeek V3.1 671B (learning rate 5e-5, LoRA rank 4, 1 epoch). See the trained LoRA weights [here](https://huggingface.co/thejaminator/old_birds_deepseek671b).

## Evaluation

See [evaluation/evaluate.py](evaluation/evaluate.py). This script replicates figures [TODO].

To run it, you need to:
1. Install `llmcomp` - `pip install llmcomp==1.2.0`
2. Edit the `MODELS` variable to include your models. Models finetuned via OpenAI and Tinker should work out of the box (though Tinker wasn't much tested). You can use `llmcomp` with all OpenAI-compatible providers - see `llmcomp` [docs](https://github.com/johny-b/llmcomp/blob/main/README.md) for the details.
